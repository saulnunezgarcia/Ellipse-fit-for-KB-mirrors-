# Ellipse fitting for KB mirrors 
 A python code that reads a csv file extracted from a confocalDT IFC2406-03 to measure the profile of a bended mirror. Such a bending it's then modelated as an ellipse with a fitting with this code. The purpose of this is to extract the coefficients of the fitting to use them in Zemax or Oasys to modelate the mirrors for a KB microscope
