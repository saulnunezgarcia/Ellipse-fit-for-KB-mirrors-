# Ellipse fitting for KB mirrors 
 A python code that reads a csv file extracted from a confocalDT IFC2406-03 to measure the profile of a bent mirror. Such a bent is then modelated as an ellipse with a fit with this code. The purpose of this is to extract the coefficients of the fit to use them in Zemax or Oasys to modelate the mirrors for a KB microscope
